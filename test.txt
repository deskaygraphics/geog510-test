Geospatial Engineering is a multidisciplinary field that integrates science, engineering, and 
technology to collect, analyze, interpret, and visualize spatial data related to the Earth's 
surface and its features. It encompasses a wide range of applications, from mapping and surveying to urban planning, 
environmental monitoring, disaster management, and beyond. Geospatial engineers use advanced tools and technologies 
to understand the spatial relationships 
between physical, environmental, and human-made systems.

Key Components of Geospatial Engineering:
Geospatial Data Collection:

Utilizes technologies like Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Remote Sensing (satellites, drones, LiDAR), and surveying instruments to gather accurate spatial data.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS):

Software platforms like ArcGIS and QGIS are used to store, analyze, and visualize geospatial data, enabling decision-making for various applications.
