Geospatial Engineering is a multidisciplinary field that integrates science, engineering, and 
technology to collect, analyze, interpret, and visualize spatial data related to the Earth's 
surface and its features. It encompasses a wide range of applications, from mapping and surveying to urban planning, 
environmental monitoring, disaster management, and beyond. Geospatial engineers use advanced tools and technologies 
to understand the spatial relationships 
between physical, environmental, and human-made systems.
